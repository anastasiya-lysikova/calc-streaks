# Calculating Streaks in Pandas

In this project we'll focus on how to find and calculate streaks in data. This allows us to detect interesting trends, calculate some summaries and visualize our findings. 

First of all, we must define what a streak is. A streak is an uninterrupted sequence of certain actions or events, e.g. sequence of success in games or competitions like "winning streak". This metric is commonly used in sports. But this term can be applied to other areas as well. For instance, this method can be used to count consecutive days logging in to an app or website.

As we mentioned before, calculating streaks is common for sports, so we'll be working with [NBA dataset](https://data.world/jaypeedevlin/2018-nba-playoff-shot-data), containing shot data from the 2018 NBA playoffs.

For this project, I use the tutorial of [Josh Delvin](https://joshdevlin.com/) about calculating streaks in Pandas.
